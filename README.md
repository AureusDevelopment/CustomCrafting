CustomCrafting allows you to create custom recipes for a vast variety of
workstations including:  
Crafting Table, Furnace, Blast Furnace, Smoker, Smithing, and more.

Additionally, you can toggle vanilla recipes as you like, and disable and override them.

It integrates with other plugins like Oraxen, ItemsAdder, MMOItems, and MythicMobs to support
your custom items and update recipes automatically when they are changed.
